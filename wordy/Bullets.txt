OpenAir-VPN
May 2023 – Present

• Being fed up with the inconsistencies of third party Linux VPN clients, and with native Wireguard and OpenVPN client software lacking desired features, I sought out the create my own custom VPN front-end command line interface for Linux.
• Created the open-source MIT-licensed OpenAir-VPN, a sophisticated Bash shell script command-line interface (CLI) with minimal dependencies that enables users to connect/disconnect from a wireguard or OpenVPN VPN server, selecting from different locations.
• The CLI includes a killswitch created with native Linux iptables rules, optional LAN connection, and integration with Systemd for startup/shutdown support.


Baseball Analytics Dashboard
Sep. 2021 – May 2022

• Utilized a Python Flask web server back-end to serve my application with Flask sessions to keep track of user progress. Created a custom Docker image to host my application.
• Designed the UI/UX of the Front-End, then utilized HTML/CSS, Javascript, and jQuery to style the application, provide quiz interactivity, and display video content.
• Resulted in most users going from 0 knowledge to being able to successfully identify the four baseball pitches with at least 85% accuracy.
